----------------------------------

What is double-beta decay
- Show Feynman diagram
- If discovered, it implies X,Y,Z.
- Show spectrum
-- it's a mono-energetic peak; energy resolution is important.

----------------------------------

What is EXO-200
- xenon
- very clean materials
- deep underground
- two modes of energy measurement: light and charge
- why are both modes important for energy resolution?
- energy resolution is limited by scintillation

----------------------------------

Denoising
- why does denoising look like something which should work
- what are we going to try to do
- mathematical setup
- big matrix solution
- solution takes place at NERSC; after significant optimization, 1 Hz/core, so 50,000 core-hours for our dataset.

----------------------------------

Results
- Resolution-vs-energy plot
- What does our fit look like
-- comparison before/after in ROI
- What does our profile curve look like before/after
- What limit does that set (text-only slide, limit in counts, half-life, and mass, as a table)
- Show Ge-vs-Xe plot

---------------------------------

Outlook?  (Or is that too much for this talk?)
